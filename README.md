KiCad for two digit serial nixie display

This is a two digit nixie display. It takes BCD data in serially, and multiples can be daisy chained. ALl power is to be supplied 
externally. THis is just the tubes, shift registers and decoders, and assorted support passives.

After HD failure ate DipTrace version, trying again in KiCad, and putting it up on GitHub for safety. Feel free to grab this, but 
since the whole thing is a learning experience by design, I make no claimes as to suitability.
